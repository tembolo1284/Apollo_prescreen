"""B.	Corporate Yield Curve Construction

Construct a credit yield curve based on a seasoned, investment-grade corporation. Identify benchmark issues and
appropriate credit spreads. Explain interpolation methods.  As the source of data and ultimately the credit curve,
chose a corporation with a relatively large, sufficient number of variable structure issues. A suggested example is
IBM, as shown in the table below, whose issues include both bullet and callable bonds. The table lists IBM outstanding
corporate bonds limited to issues in USD. Document and explain source data used such risk-free rate curve, comparable
spreads, and whatever assumptions need to be made. Try to gather actual rate data from available sources (if - for
example â€“ Bloomberg is not available, refer to other public sources such as FRED, etc). Importantly, supply all the
source data along with your output, and if any assumptions and approximations or estimates need to be made, state
what those are.
